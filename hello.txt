Hello friends,

I would like to introduce MATLAB test codes related to alignment theories.
These codes show how the Virtual Alignment Method works using a 2D Shepp?Logan phantom.
If you change only fp_r and fp_phi in the code, the position of the CT image will change in the reconstruction.

Thanks for your interest in my code and theory.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
